# Overview

The software I wrote is a simple contacts app using the Kotlin programming language!
Below is a link to my demo of the program and a quick overview of how it works.

# Development Environment

I used the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition program to code this. 

I used the Kotlin programming language.

# Useful Websites

Below are a couple of the websites I used to help me with this project, since I was pretty
unfamiliar with Kotlin before this. The programiz.com one was helpful to just get some basic syntax down
and the kotlinlang.org one was helpful for when I needed to find out something specific about Kotlin.

- [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)

# Future Work

Below are a couple of things/features I would like to implement sometime in the future

- The ability for a contact to be marked as a 'favorite.' It would show up at the top of the contacts list.
- Possibly more entry fields when making the contact. Things like middle name, work, etc...
